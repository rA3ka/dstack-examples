# Custom Domain Setup for dstack Applications

This repository provides a solution for setting up custom domains with automatic SSL certificate management for dstack applications using Cloudflare DNS and Let's Encrypt.

## Overview

This project enables you to run dstack applications with your own custom domain, complete with:

- Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal via Let's Encrypt
- Cloudflare DNS configuration for CNAME, TXT, and CAA records
- Nginx reverse proxy to route traffic to your application
- Certificate evidence generation for verification

## How It Works

The dstack-ingress system provides a seamless way to set up custom domains for dstack applications with automatic SSL certificate management. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - When first deployed, the container automatically obtains SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt using DNS validation
   - It configures Cloudflare DNS by creating necessary CNAME, TXT, and optional CAA records
   - Nginx is configured to use the obtained certificates and proxy requests to your application

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - A CNAME record is created to point your custom domain to the dstack gateway domain
   - A TXT record is added with application identification information to help dstack-gateway to route traffic to your application
   - If enabled, CAA records are set to restrict which Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain

3. **Certificate Management**:
   - SSL certificates are automatically obtained during initial setup
   - A scheduled task runs twice daily to check for certificate renewal
   - When certificates are renewed, Nginx is automatically reloaded to use the new certificates

4. **Evidence Generation**:
   - The system generates evidence files for verification purposes
   - These include the ACME account information and certificate data
   - Evidence files are accessible through a dedicated endpoint

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Host your domain on Cloudflare and have access to the Cloudflare account with API token

### Deployment

You can either build the ingress container and push it to docker hub, or use the prebuilt image at `kvin/dstack-ingress`.

#### Option 1: Use the Pre-built Image

The fastest way to get started is to use our pre-built image. Simply use the following docker-compose configuration:

```yaml
services:
  dstack-ingress:
    image: kvin/dstack-ingress@sha256:8dfc3536d1bd0be0cb938140aeff77532d35514ae580d8bec87d3d5a26a21470
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
      - DOMAIN=${DOMAIN}
      - GATEWAY_DOMAIN=${GATEWAY_DOMAIN}
      - CERTBOT_EMAIL=${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      - SET_CAA=true
      - TARGET_ENDPOINT=http://app:80
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - cert-data:/etc/letsencrypt
    restart: unless-stopped
  app:
    image: nginx  # Replace with your application image
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  cert-data:  # Persistent volume for certificates
```

Explanation of environment variables:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
- `DOMAIN`: Your custom domain
- `GATEWAY_DOMAIN`: The dstack gateway domain. (e.g. `_.dstack-prod5.phala.network` for Phala Cloud)
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: Your email address used in Let's Encrypt certificate requests
- `TARGET_ENDPOINT`: The plain HTTP endpoint of your dstack application
- `SET_CAA`: Set to `true` to enable CAA record setup

#### Option 2: Build Your Own Image

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t yourusername/dstack-ingress .
```

3. Push to your registry (optional):

```bash
docker push yourusername/dstack-ingress
```

4. Update the docker-compose.yaml file with your image name and deploy

## Domain Attestation and Verification

The dstack-ingress system provides mechanisms to verify and attest that your custom domain endpoint is secure and properly configured. This comprehensive verification approach ensures the integrity and authenticity of your application.

### Evidence Collection

When certificates are issued or renewed, the system automatically generates a set of cryptographically linked evidence files:

1. **Access Evidence Files**:
   - Evidence files are accessible at `https://your-domain.com/evidences/`
   - Key files include `acme-account.json`, `cert.pem`, `sha256sum.txt`, and `quote.json`

2. **Verification Chain**:
   - `quote.json` contains a TDX quote with the SHA-256 digest of `sha256sum.txt` embedded in the report_data field
   - `sha256sum.txt` contains cryptographic checksums of both `acme-account.json` and `cert.pem`
   - When the TDX quote is verified, it cryptographically proves the integrity of the entire evidence chain

3. **Certificate Authentication**:
   - `acme-account.json` contains the ACME account credentials used to request certificates
   - When combined with the CAA DNS record, this provides evidence that certificates can only be requested from within this specific TEE application
   - `cert.pem` is the Let's Encrypt certificate currently serving your custom domain

### CAA Record Verification

If you've enabled CAA records (`SET_CAA=true`), you can verify that only authorized Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain:

```bash
dig CAA your-domain.com
```

The output will display CAA records that restrict certificate issuance exclusively to Let's Encrypt with your specific account URI, providing an additional layer of security.

### TLS Certificate Transparency

All Let's Encrypt certificates are logged in public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, enabling independent verification:

**CT Log Verification**:
   - Visit [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) and search for your domain
   - Confirm that the certificates match those issued by the dstack-ingress system
   - This public logging ensures that all certificates are visible and can be monitored for unauthorized issuance
